    <p>
    <strong>Beyond Blue</strong> works with the community to improve mental health and prevent suicide, so that all people in Australia can achieve their best possible mental health. Through our <strong>Beyond 2020 Strategy</strong>, we are working across three strategic priorities:
</p>
    <p>
Promoting mental health and wellbeing so people have greater knowledge, feel safe to talk openly about their issues and are supported to ask for help when they need to.
Being a trusted source of information, advice and support so we can all better understand how to maintain our mental health and take steps to recover from mental health conditions.
Working together to prevent suicide by playing a lead role in the national effort to prevent suicide through research, information, advice and support, and advocacy. 
We ensure community is at the heart of everything we do. Our success is dependent on our deep commitment to actively listen to, understand, partner with and respond to community experience and needs. By learning from and working with community, Beyond Blue can better reach and support people who need us, and adapt to the evolving mental health needs of people living in Australia.
 </p>
    <p>
<strong>We are the ‘Big Blue Door’ for many in the community</strong>: a safe and reliable place for millions of people to access information, advice and support, no matter where they are on the mental health continuum – whether they’re well and want to stay that way, unwell and need support, or in recovery and want to reconnect with others and give back.
 </p>
    <p>
Our aim over the coming years is to streamline access to, and the responsiveness of, our ‘Big Blue Door’. We will build a better online platform and we will better connect with people in the community. No matter how people connect with Beyond Blue, we want everyone to have access to relevant products and services that offer information, advice and support they need.
